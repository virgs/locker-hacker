## Architectural Decisions

### PatternLock Component Architecture

**Decision:** Split PatternLock into a presentational component + `usePatternLock` hook.

**Rationale:** The original `PatternLock.tsx` was ~210 lines, exceeding the 200-line file limit and 150-line component limit from `agents.md`. All internal state, collision detection, and event handler logic now lives in `usePatternLock.ts`. The component file is now ~90 lines, purely responsible for rendering.

**Files:**
- `src/components/PatternLock.tsx` — props interface + JSX rendering
- `src/components/usePatternLock.ts` — internal state, effects, event handlers

### Container Sizing vs. Grid Dimensions

**Decision:** Two orthogonal concepts with separate props:
- `containerSize?: number | string` — the CSS size of the container (square). Default: `"100%"`.
- `width?: number` — grid **columns**. Default: `5`.
- `height?: number` — grid **rows**. Default: `5`.

**Rationale:** `width` and `height` describe the board shape (how many dots wide × tall), not the CSS size. A `3×3` board and a `2×4` board both render inside the same `containerSize` container. This naming mirrors natural language: "the board is 3 wide and 4 tall".

**Usage examples:**
```tsx
<PatternLock containerSize={200} width={3} height={3} />   // 3×3 grid, 200px container
<PatternLock containerSize={300} width={4} height={3} />   // 4 cols × 3 rows
<PatternLock containerSize="100%" width={2} height={5} />  // 2 cols × 5 rows, full width
```

### Non-Square Grid Math

**Decision:** `getPoints` accepts `cols` and `rows` separately; `getPointsInTheMiddle` accepts `cols`.

**Rationale:** Cell dimensions are computed as `cellWidth = containerWidth / cols` and `cellHeight = containerHeight / rows`, allowing asymmetric grids. `Point.tsx` uses `colPercent = 100/cols` and `rowPercent = 100/rows` for the flex layout so each cell fills its share of the container in both axes.

### Arrow Heads (`arrowHeads` prop)

**Decision:** Added `arrowHeads?: boolean` (default `false`) to `PatternLock`. When `true`, each connector line renders a CSS border-triangle at its `to` end (`left: 100%` inside the connector div).

**Rationale:** Arrow heads communicate the draw direction, making the pattern "flow" readable. The triangle size is proportional to `connectorThickness` (height ≈ 3×, length ≈ 2×). Color is driven by CSS class rules in `PatternLock.styled.tsx` (matching the connector color for each state: white / grey / green / red) so no extra color props are needed.

---

### Arrow Head on Live Line Only (`arrowHeadSize` prop)

**Decision:** The arrow head renders only on the "live" trailing connector (the line from the last selected point to the current cursor position). Completed path connectors render as plain lines with no arrow head.

**Implementation:** In `Connectors.tsx`, `liveConnectorIndex` is set to the last array index when `mouse !== null && path.length > 0`, otherwise `-1`. The arrow head div is rendered only when `i === liveConnectorIndex`.

**`arrowHeadSize` prop:** Added to `PatternLockProps` and `ConnectorsProps` (default `10`). Controls the CSS border triangle dimensions: `borderTopWidth/borderBottomWidth = arrowHeadSize`, `borderLeftWidth = Math.round(arrowHeadSize * 1.5)`.

---

### Removed `length` Prop

**Decision:** The `length` prop (which gated `onFinish` until the path reached a minimum length) was removed.

**Rationale:** Decided not to pursue this approach; `onFinish` fires on any non-empty path release.

---

## Key Constraints

- **pnpm** is the package manager (`pnpm install`, not `npm install`).
- All styled-components go in `*.styled.tsx` co-located with their component.
- File limit: 200 lines (soft). Component limit: 150 lines (soft).
- Tests must cover new/changed logic; run `pnpm test` to verify.
- ESLint config is flat (eslint 10): `eslint.config.js`. Run `pnpm lint`.

## Trade-offs

- `containerSize` default of `"100%"` means the CSS height is also `"100%"` when neither `width` nor `height` is provided. This differs from the old behavior where height was always set to a pixel value equal to `offsetWidth`. In practice all current usages pass an explicit pixel value so this has no visible impact.
